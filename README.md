## To Run
1) Download this entire repository (you can download as a zip folder using Code -> Download ZIP, or you can use GitHub Desktop). 
2) Open the project <i>BenchmarkCohortConstructor.Rproj</i> in RStudio (when inside the project, you will see its name on the top-right of your RStudio session)
3) Run `renv::activate()` and `renv::restore()` to get the relevant packages and version to run the code.
4) Open and work though the <i>CodeToRun.R</i> file which should be the only file that you need to interact with. Run the lines in the file, adding your database specific information and so on (see comments within the file for instructions). 
5) After running you should then have a zip folder with results to share.
